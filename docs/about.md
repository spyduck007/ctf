# What's up! I'm Ansh (spyduck007)

I'm a high school student at TJ, passionate about cybersecurity and learning through CTFs. Most of my hands-on work happens with my club team:

- **[tjcsc](https://ctftime.org/team/53812)** — where I participate in CTFs, help organize club activities, and experiment with different security challenges.

## My interests

- Diving into cryptography, forensics, and networking
- Exploring reverse engineering, web exploitation, and other CTF categories as they come up

## What I’m working on

- Preparing lectures and challenges for TJCSC in-house events
- Improving my write-ups and documentation of solutions
- Expanding my skills in rev and pwn (im really bad at them) and related fields
